# Python-Image-Steganography
Devised a 2-way encryption+decryption algorithm that helps hide text in images using the LSB steganography technique using the PIL library. This image can be sent to anyone, but can only be decoded correctly with the help of a key set by the sender. Coded particularly for Google Colab.
